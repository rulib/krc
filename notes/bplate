Library implementors face similar hurdles. Even if the design is done
well, a poor implementation will scare off users. If an implementation is
too slow or too big — or just perceived to be so — programmers will
design their own replacements.

Worst of all, if an implementation has
bugs, it shatters the ideal outlined above and renders the library useless.
This book describes the design and implementation of a library that is
suitable for a wide range of applications written in the C programming
language. The library exports a set of modules that provide functions
and data structures for “programming-in-the-small.” These modules are
suitable for use as “piece parts” in applications or application components
that are a few thousand lines long.

Isn't this exciting!~

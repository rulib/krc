End of section 1:
*1-20 Detab: done and fixed
*1-21 Entab: done and tested
1-22 Fold lines: not started
*1-23 Decomment: done for multiline comments, not tracking //, 
	excessively general, reusable probably for 1-24
1-24 The Big Boy: base on excessively general 1-23, don't spend too much time
	debugging this or testing weird cases, you don't know the edge cases in C
	well enough to bother.

Sections 2, 3, and 4 are pretty chill and rehash modern C kind of, just more language
details.  5 is POINTERS which is why you need to soldier through 1-21, 22, 24

K&R C (At Sea?)
===============
Hello!  For any curious visitors, in this repo I will be posting my solutions to the problem sets found in Kernighan and Ritchie's classic text, *The C Programming Language* (Second Edition).  I started working through these problems while sailing on the *Maersk Wisconsin*, and have created this repository now that I have returned to land (and broadband).  I hope that my solutions will be enlightening to anyone who stumbles upon this page.

As of now (January 2017), I am working my way through the long exercises at the end of Chapter 1.  I think these are intimidating to a lot of people reading this book, and give it a reputation for being one of the denser introductory language texts out there.  If anyone else feels as intimidated by these as I did at first, just keep working at them - they are meant to take a while.  The more interesting features of the language lie just ahead.
